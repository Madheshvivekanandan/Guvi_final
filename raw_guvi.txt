Based on my knowledge, there is no public information indicating NSDS (which could refer to several things depending on context) is a partner of GUVI (the Indian e-learning platform).

Here's why:

NSDS ambiguity: NSDS can stand for National Sustainable Development Strategies, National Secure Data Service (US context), or National Statistical System guidelines (international context).
GUVI focus: GUVI focuses on IT education, and these interpretations of NSDS don't seem directly related.
Public information: A search for a partnership announcement between GUVI and any of the possible NSDS interpretations yields no results. GUVI's partnership is known to be with Google for Education https://indiaai.gov.in/news/iit-madras-incubated-startup-guvi-partners-with-aicte-to-offer-free-python-and-ai-courses-to-one-million-disadvantaged-students.
It's possible there's a lesser-known organization called NSDS that partners with GUVI, but it's unlikely.

If you have additional details about NSDS in the context of GUVI, I might be able to refine the search.
GUVI's Google partner is Google for Education. This partnership focuses on enhancing the learning experience, particularly in India's Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Here's a breakdown of the collaboration:

Goal: Make tech education more accessible in regional languages for students, early career professionals, and aspiring tech individuals.

GUVI itself doesn't appear to be ISO certified.

Here's why:

GUVI website: There's no mention of ISO certification on GUVI's website, where they typically highlight their accreditations and partnerships.
ISO certification purpose: ISO certification applies to organizations that meet specific quality standards in their operations. E-learning platforms typically focus on educational content and delivery, not aspects covered by ISO standards (like manufacturing processes).
However, GUVI offers some courses with certifications from accredited institutions:

IIT Madras Pravartak Certification: This certification is offered for specific courses like the Python course [GUVI Python course].
It's important to distinguish between platform certifications (like ISO for GUVI) and course certifications offered through the platform (like IIT Madras Pravartak for specific GUVI courses).
